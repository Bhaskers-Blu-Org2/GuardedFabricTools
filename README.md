# Guarded Fabric Tools

A PowerShell module containing tools to make deploying shielded virtual machines and managing a guarded fabric easier.

Included tools:
- **New-ShieldedVM** helps you deploy a shielded VM from PowerShell using a template disk and shielding data file. This function is intended for use on a guarded host.
- **ConvertTo-ShieldedVM** allows you to quickly add a virtual TPM and security policy to an existing VM. This function is intended for use on a guarded host.
- **New-ShieldingDataAnswerFile** generates answer files (also called unattend files) that automate configuration of Windows or Linux in a shielded VM. These answer files are compliant with System Center Virtual Machine Manager and `New-ShieldedVM`. This function is intended for use on the machine where you are preparing a shielding data file.
- **Get-HgsAttestationReport** queries the event log on an HGS server for information about recent attestation attempts to help you understand which hosts have tried attesting and whether or not they passed. This function is intended for use on an HGS server. [Additional documentation](./AttestationReport/Usage.md)
- **Add-AccessRule** and its accompanying extensions to the X509Certificate2 class in PowerShell allow you to manage the access control list (ACL) on certificate private keys through PowerShell. This function is intended for use on an HGS server when granting the group managed service account access to use the HGS encryption and signing keys. [Additional documentation](./CertificateManagement/Usage.md)
